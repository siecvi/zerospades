## What is OpenSpades?
[OpenSpades](https://github.com/yvt/openspades) is a compatible client of [Ace Of Spades](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ace_of_Spades_(video_game)) 0.75.

* Can connect to a vanilla/[pyspades](https://code.google.com/archive/p/pyspades)/[PySnip](https://github.com/NateShoffner/PySnip)/[piqueserver](https://github.com/piqueserver/piqueserver)/[SpadeX](https://github.com/SpadesX/SpadesX) server.
* Uses OpenGL/AL for better experience.
* Open source, and cross platform.

## Ok but what the heck is ZeroSpades?
ZeroSpades is a fork of OpenSpades with extra features and many improvements/fixes.

Some of the most important changes are:

* In-Game HitTest Debugger (ty BR <3).
* Extended block color palette (ty Liza&Vier <3).
* Improved firstperson weapon animations (ty PTrooper <3).
* More thirdperson animations.
* Firstperson playermodels (torso&legs).
* Classic firstperson viewmodel
* Different playermodels depending on weapon class.
* Classic randomized dirt color.
* Dead player corpse & falling blocks physics.
* Client-side hit analyzer (showing hit player name, distance, and which body part it hit).
* Player names while on spectator mode.
* Teammate names on minimap.
* Damage dealt to players are now shown as floating text.
* Player statistics such as kill/death ratio, kill streak, number of melee/grenade kills, and blocks placed.
* Customizable HUD position and color.
* Customizable crosshair & scope.
* Same fog tint/color as the classic client (openspades applies a [bluish tint](https://github.com/yvt/openspades/blob/v0.1.3/Resources/Shaders/Fog.vs#L27) to the fog).
* Demo recording compatible with [aos_replay](https://github.com/BR-/aos_replay) format.

-- And a lot of other things that I forgot to mention here.

## Demo Recording & Playback

ZeroSpades supports recording and playing back gameplay demos using a format compatible with [aos_replay](https://github.com/BR-/aos_replay).

### Recording

Record gameplay from the command line:

```bash
# Record demos to mydemo_1.dem, mydemo_2.dem, etc. (one per game/map)
openspades aos://server:port --record mydemo
```

Demos are saved with a numeric suffix for each game joined during the session.

### Playback

Play back demos directly in ZeroSpades:

```bash
# Play a demo file
openspades /path/to/demo.dem

# Or with the explicit flag
openspades --replay /path/to/demo.dem
```

Demos can also be played back using the external [aos_replay](https://github.com/BR-/aos_replay) tool.

## How to Build/Install?
See the [OpenSpades Building&Installing Guide](https://github.com/yvt/openspades#how-to-buildinstall)

Just a quick note when building on [Windows](https://github.com/yvt/openspades#on-windows-with-visual-studio) (with vcpkg):

On CMake, before you configure the project, you will need to add a new string entry:

* With the Name field: `VCPKG_TARGET_TRIPLET`
* And the Value field: `x86-windows-static`

Then you're ready to configure & generate.
